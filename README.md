This script can search all your tickets which you was involved in during month and log time there for getting month norm.
It can be usefull in the end of month because manual time loggining is quite annoying. 

```
time_to_ticket = (month_norm - logged_time) / amount_of_tickets
```

so **time_to_ticket** will be logged to each ticket for getting norm.

Script produces such output:

```
